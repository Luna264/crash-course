# crash course
**what is this**

this is my other baby CRASH COURSE, a silly very high realistic (Im lying) dare i say "simulation" where you spawn the car and the car go crash

**why?**

i was running low on time (more on that later) and i wanted to use the stuff i already knew to make something cute and simple rather than spend time learning something entirely new and end up not finishing at all. thats crash course!

**how?**

this project was in made in godot using GDScript and inkscape for the art (which was completely new, ive never used vector art but it turned out alright with this one!!)

**struggles**

time. time. time. nothing was actually hard about this project itself, but the overlooming threat of running out of time put a lot of pressure on me to work faster and so i made sillier mistakes. its very clear from the art and barebones features that i was fighting against the clock here...i wish i had more time to fully flesh out this project to its full potential, but what can you dooo!!! anyway, im still pretty happy with what i made :)
